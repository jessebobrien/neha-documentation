# New England Hillclimb Series

## Regulations  2023

```
Changes to 2022 rules are indicated in bold italic.
```
1. Hillclimbs are a two-day event. The only person who can make
    exceptions to this rule is the event chair. Drivers wishing to participate
    on Sunday only must be preregistered and it must be cleared with the
    event chair; such drivers lose the right to protest.
2. A valid driver’s license must be shown at registration, without exception.
    Drivers, workers, and other participants must sign, and therefore accept
    the terms of, all releases required for the event. This may include club,
    landowner, municipal, state, and medical treatment/transport releases.
3. All entrants shall state that they either own their vehicle or have
    permission to use it, prior to running an event. This information will be
    stated on the entry form for each event.
4. If there are more than 2 drivers in a car, or more than 2 cars per driver,
    those drivers may not get a full set of runs, despite regulation 16. One
    entry per car, per driver.
5. Notification of time and place of the mandatory new driver orientation

shall be provided in the entry package.

6. Entrants are to present cars and equipment as they will be used.
    Alternate wheels/tires to be used at the event must be checked by
    Tech Inspection. The review of record for Tech is the Technical
    Committee, with the chairperson acting as an ex parte member as

necessary.

7. All participants, workers, and crew will be issued identification indicating

that they have signed release forms and are allowed to be on the hill.

8. No one other than workers, drivers, and those given permission by the
    event chair will be on the course, or beyond set barriers. The only
    exception to this would be on courses set on roads that are public ways

and must be opened to the public periodically throughout the event.

9. No one under the age of 18 will be on the course at any time or for any
    reason while the course is open. The only exception is that minors age
    16–18 may work on the course with a fully executed minor release form.
    These forms are available from the sponsoring club. It is suggested that
    the event chair be contacted prior to the event if 16 to 18 year-olds wish

to work.

10. Refunds to entrants for withdrawn entries or failure to pass Technical
    Inspection will be made solely at the discretion of the sponsoring clubs.
11. If a car crashes, it is subject to a new technical inspection before
    running again, at the discretion of the Technical Inspector.
       12. Each driver must attend a drivers’ meeting each day before he or she is
          allowed to make a competition, practice, or familiarization run. The
          location for posting announcements pertaining to the event will be
          announced during the drivers meeting. Drivers are responsible for being
          aware of updates at all times.
       13. Each driver must complete a satisfactory familiarization run before
          making a timed run and must be given the opportunity to be a driver
       during a familiarization run.^
       14. There will be at least one familiarization run on Sunday.
       15. There will be no practice runs on Sunday under any condition.
       16. Practice and timed runs will be done in “heats.” Entrants will have the
          same opportunity for the same number of runs. If an entrant cannot
          make a run during the allotted time, he/she will forfeit that run and take
          the next run.
       17. Race car and driver shall remain in full race preparedness while on the
          course. This includes familiarization, practice and timed runs as well as
          all bring downs.
       18. The start will be standing, with the rear wheels blocked. The decision to
          permit tire warmups (or “burnouts”) is at the discretion of the chair. The
          starter’s countdown will not start until a signal is given by the driver that
          he/she is ready. Drivers will be told whether timing is starting from
          the countdown or from the beam break.
       19. Reruns will be given if the timer misses a time or the entrant is red-
          flagged for course problems. If flagged for any reason the driver must
          wait at the checkpoint until given instructions for coming down.
       20. If a driver acknowledges he/she is ready, it is considered a timed run. It
          is the responsibility of Control and the starter to judge the fairness of a
          driver’s start. In the event of an unfair start the driver shall receive a 10-
       second penalty.
       21. If for any reason a driver does not finish a timed run, he/she must wait at
          the nearest checkpoint for further instructions. Any a driver not adhering
       to this rule may be disqualified immediately.
       22. Protests must be filed with the event chair within two hours after the last
          run on Saturday or within one-half hour of the last run on Sunday in
          order to be considered. If it is a protest for the Technical or
          Classification Committee, the chair will forward it to that committee with
          his/her recommendation. (Keep in mind that all sponsoring clubs are
          represented on the protest committees.) Entrants registered for Sunday
       only can be protested at any time.
       23. The decision of the protest committee must be unanimous or the protest
       automatically fails.


24. At all hillclimbs, the holding area (after finish) must have communication
    with Control and all checkpoints.
25. Hillclimbs will be run in inclement weather unless there is danger to
    course workers or the integrity of the course. Consideration will be given
    to visibility, road surface, and communications. The decision to run is
    the responsibility of the event chair and his/her decision will be final.
26. Event awards will be based on Sunday’s times if a run is completed on
    Sunday. If Saturday's times are used for awards in case of cancellation
    on Sunday, they will be used across the board; no exceptions.
27. The “New England Hillclimb Association”, (aka “NEHA”, “New England
    Hillclimb Series”, ”NEHA Family”) is a joint venture (DBA) of the New
    England Sports Car Club Council, Inc., for the use of its member clubs
    in the promotion and operation of hillclimbs. The Council, and its
    member clubs, are not owned by, or subordinate to, any other sanction
    or organization. Any specifications incorporated herein are for reference
    purposes, and represent known and accepted practices, trade
    standards, and equivalences.
28. In case of a cancellation due to weather, etc. the event chair may or
    may not issue a partial refund. Since there are many expenses involved
    in setting up a hillclimb, total refunds cannot be given in the event of
    cancellation. A sponsoring club could not put on events if it had to

absorb all the costs of a canceled hillclimb.

29. Any per diems, tow money, merchandise, awards, or contingencies
    disbursed to workers or drivers is done so in reimbursement of
    expenses incurred, and in no way constitute an employer relationship or
    wage. All such items are paid or distributed at the discretion of the

sponsoring club.

30. There will be no racing anywhere other than on the course during timed
    runs. At the option of the chair, pace or speed controls may be imposed
    on noncompetitive transits or bringdowns. Penalties for violations may
    include loss of runs or disqualification. Running a red flag constitutes a
    violation.
31. No alcohol or drugs to be consumed by anyone having to do with the
    event until the course is officially closed for the day. Drivers are
    responsible for their crew and anyone they bring with them. No alcohol
    or drugs are to be kept on the course at any time.
32. Any personal or property damage incurred is the total responsibility of
    the individual and shall not be borne by the sponsoring club or its
    agents.
33. Drivers are subject to disqualification or alternate penalty at any time if
    they do not adhere to the rules.
       34. It is the responsibility of the event chair to interpret and enforce the
          rules. However, no event chair may lessen the effect or intent of any
          technical or safety regulation. Any participant displaying
          unsportsmanlike conduct or unacceptable behavior, as defined by the
          chairperson, may be removed and/or disqualified from the event by the
          chairperson. The board of directors of the sponsoring club reserves the
          right to take further action, including barring entry from one or more
       future events sponsored by the affected club.
       35. Annual points are computed by dividing each driver’s time for each
          event into the winning time for the event. For Class points the winning
          time for the class is used. For King of the Hill points FTD is used. The
          resulting fractions are totaled for the year, highest total wins. A DNS or
          DNF counts as a zero fraction. If there are 5–6 events, then the worst
          event for each driver will be dropped. If there are 7 or more events, then
          the worst two events for each driver will be dropped. A driver must enter
          3 events to qualify for year-end placings. All events that are not dropped
          must be in the same class to qualify for the class placings. If an event is
          rained out both days, all drivers who have gone through registration will
          be awarded a score of 1. Any entrant running under a promoter's
          exception and not meeting these rules will have that event be excluded
          from the annual points. Events that impose additional restrictions on
          drivers or cars beyond these rules, other than those required to use the
       hill facilities, will not be included in the annual points.
       36. All checkpoints shall be manned by a minimum of two workers during
          timed runs.
       37. The WEZIL award (in memory of Jim Gosselin) may be awarded for
          technical excellence in preparation.
       38. Drivers are responsible for any haz-mat spills from their cars and
          pit equipment, anywhere on the venue. They are responsible for
          timely cleanup, and disposal of any sorbents, residue, and
          cleaning materials. Course workers will respond to any spill on
          course, but the driver is ultimately responsible for disposal.
          Sorbents, brooms, etc. will be available at START, and after
          FINISH. Each car must carry a disposal (trash) bag, a spill kit is
          recommended.
       39. All access trails that meet the hillclimb road shall have at least barrier
          tape and/or a posting across the trail.
       40. In order to submit or vote on a proposal that pertains to a NEHA rule, the
          person must be a member of KSCC, SCCNH or SCCV, must be of age
          to be a driver (18) or worker (16) in a NEHA hillclimb as of the date of
          the rules meeting, and have participated at a hillclimb in the last three
          years, either as a worker or driver.


41. A prepared driver can use an unprepared car or street prepared car
    (referred to as “replacement car”) to accrue points in their class as long
    as the “replacement car” the driver is running falls under the safety
    guidelines for the class of the “replacement car”. This means; if it is an
    uncaged car, it must run in accordance to the breakout rule for that
    vehicle. The driver can use this option one time in a Hillclimb calendar
    year. The finishing position for the “replacement car” will determine the
    points awarded to the driver for that event. The “replacement car” that
    is used must not exceed the classification rules for the prepared class in
    which it is being scored.
42. All drivers are responsible at the event to ensure their class and other
    information is correct. Drivers must notify the event organizers or the
    NEHA Points Keeper with result errors within 14 days of results being
    posted on Hillclimb.org.
43. Technical and Classification Committees
    a) Requirements: Sound automotive knowledge, must have
       attended a minimum of one-half of the NEHA events the prior
       season. The Technical Inspector cannot be a full time
       committee member.
    b) Committee members must be reconfirmed or replaced each
       year at the NEHA rules meeting via individuals who can vote
       on rule proposals. Interested individuals may submit their
       name at the meeting for consideration and voting.
    c) If either committee is needed at an event and there are not at
       least three in attendance for the specific committee, the event
       chairperson will act as a committee member. If only one
       committee member is at the event, both the event chairperson
       and a Technical Inspector will act as committee members.
