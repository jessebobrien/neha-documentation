# Worker Tip Sheet

## The Bottom Line

® Workers are Control’s eyes and ears on the hill.
® There must always be two workers at a station.
® One person must always man the phone. Second person
carries radio and responds to incidents.
® A worker’s own safety comes before a driver’s safety.

## Clothing and Equipment

® Pack for the current season plus the one before and
after. All weather conditions are possible, if not likely!
Expect to add and subtract layers for two days, and carry
these with you.
® Required: truly waterproof rain gear—including footwear
or a change of shoes. Chair. Plastic bags (large) to put
over equipment and chairs, and for trash (we are
required to carry out everything we carry in). Umbrella for
rain or sun. Hat and gloves. Sunglasses. Bug spray.
Snacks and liquids. Toilet paper.
® Optional: Camera. Stopwatch for split times. Paper and
pencil. Entertainment, such as a book, in case of delays.

## General Setup

® Upon arrival at checkpoint: confirm presence of headset,
speaker, and battery; fire extinguisher; broom; Speedy
Dry; red flag.
® Connect phone to battery. Connect speaker to drop line,
turn on, and place as far away as possible. Adjust
volume so it does not squeal. Place other equipment in
easily accessible location; unravel flag.
® Report to Control (“Check 3 to Control...”)

## Duties

® Listen to phone/radio communications and keep track of
all cars during their passage from the checkpoint below
you to the checkpoint above you.

- During fam runs: report the first car and last car
    past your checkpoint (“Car 9 past Check 3”)
- During timed runs: report each car past your
    checkpoint.
- During breaks: report service vehicles or civilian
    vehicles past your checkpoint, up or down.
® Repeat until Control acknowledges.
® What to report:
- Routine—cars that pull in to your checkpoint;
workers leaving/returning to checkpoint; fluid spills,
dragging or dropped parts, excessive smoke;
drivers not wearing helmets or behaving unsafely;
unauthorized spectators.
- Emergency—cars off the course; cars stopped on
the course and unable to continue; hard impacts;
rollovers; cars taking way too long to get to next
checkpoint and can’t be heard.
® How to report:
- Press the button; speak clearly and firmly into the
mouthpiece (“Check 3 to Control...”); release
button; listen for acknowledgment before
continuing.
- Speak only to Control unless given permission to
speak to anyone else.

# Worker Tip Sheet

## Emergency Procedures

```
® Treat all accidents as emergencies then downgrade
later. It is better to overreact than fail to act when quick
response was needed.
® Person manning phone must jump in with “Emergency at
Check 3” [or wherever you are] and report which car,
where it is, and what help is required. Do not offer any
details. STAY ON THE PHONE.
® Drivers whose cars have horns will honk twice if they are
O-K or lean on the horn for one long bleat if they need
Helllllllllp! Report any honking to Control.
```
## Responding to Incidents

```
® Person not manning phone must grab fire extinguisher
(plus radio and fire glove, if applicable) and head to the
incident. Note that moving vehicles that might still be on
the hill. Report to Control upon arrival if radio available;
otherwise, stabilize situation then report back to
checkpoint. Any driver involved in a hard impact or
rollover must be seen by ambulance crew.
® Driver will probably be out of the car before anyone gets
there. If so, make him sit down until safety crew arrives.
If still in car, attempt to keep him there until safety crew
arrives, especially if he appears injured. (Only exception:
if driver is in danger from fire.) If cars is upside-down,
make sure driver understands which way is up before
undoing belts.
® In case of fire: pull pin on fire extinguisher, aim at BASE
of fire, and squeeze handle, sweeping back and forth. If
fire is under the hood, try to shoot the extinguisher up
from under the car. If in the cockpit with driver still inside,
spray the driver if you have to.
® If possible, make sure a disabled car is turned off. The
fancier race cars will have a “kill switch” on the outside,
marked with a lightning bolt, with which you can cut off
the juice. All other cars are controlled by key in ignition.
® Report status to Control via radio or else stabilize
situation then return to checkpoint.
```
## Communications Failure

```
® If an accident cuts the phone line and there is no
handheld radio contact, Finish will serve as Control from
the break upward, while Control will communicate to
checkpoints from the break downward.
```
## Red Flag

```
® Hold flag open and sway (vs. flap by handle) in driver’s
line of sight but not in line of impact. Use when Control
instructs, or if something happens above and there is not
enough time to communicate before next car arrives.
® Drivers must stop safely, immediately, when they see a
red flag. Report to Control when driver has stopped or if
driver has failed to stop.
```
## Miscellaneous

```
® Control will always do a course check before starting a
session. Respond in sequence (“2 here”, “3 here”, etc.)
® Speak car numbers as digits (“Car one-nine” ; “car two-
five”) instead of words (“car nineteen” ; twenty-five”).
